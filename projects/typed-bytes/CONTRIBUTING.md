# Contributing

I'm very keen to get contributions from people other than me here ðŸ¥³.

If you have a small suggestion, feel free to open a pull request directly.
Otherwise, it's best to
[open an issue](https://github.com/voltrevo/monorepo/issues)
first so we can talk about it. Issues can also be contributions in themselves by
offering ideas or raising/clarifying problems that need to be solved.

I would also prefer you make a small contribution before making a larger one.
If you have big ideas you'd like to see integrated into `typed-bytes`, that
could be really great, but please find some smaller things to do first. That way
we can get a better idea of each other's expectations and make a foundation for
collaborating on bigger things.

Here are some ideas for good first contributions:
- Add an example to [examples](./examples/README.md)
  - That directory also needs a README.md and a link to it from the main
    README.md
- Add more [fractals](./examples/Shapes/demo/fractals/README.md)
- Improve on the comparisons to alternative libraries
- Fix typos
- Improve my [house design](./examples/Shapes/tutorial/step08/README.md) in the
  tutorial
- Add a bicoder for a simple standard data type that's missing, such as `Date`
  at [bicoders.ts](/src/bicoders.ts)
- Submit a proposal for making user defined data types easier to add (mainly as
  an example of what the user code would look like)
- Tell me why `typed-bytes` is not suitable for your TypeScript project

## Code of Conduct

Let's keep this simple. `typed-bytes` is a welcoming and inclusive place. Please
be kind to each other and try to get along. Don't do things that make others
uncomfortable.

Please get in touch if you witness or experience unacceptable behavior from
others. I have an @gmail.com address and the username is the same as my GitHub
username.
